# PRODUCTION EMAIL AND PDF STORAGE ISSUE - COMPLETE RESOLUTION

## üö® CRITICAL PRODUCTION ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED

### **Problem**: 
After successful PayPal payment, emails were not being sent to customers and PDFs were not being stored in Sanity CMS, even though payment status was updating correctly.

### **Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Base URL Resolution Failure**: In production, the base URL was resolving to `localhost:3000` instead of the actual domain
2. **Serverless Environment Issues**: `setImmediate()` wrapper was not executing properly in Vercel's serverless environment
3. **HTTP Fetch Failures**: Async HTTP fetch calls to internal APIs were failing due to incorrect base URL resolution
4. **Environment Variable Issues**: Production environment variables were not being accessed correctly

---

## ‚úÖ COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### **1. Replaced HTTP Fetch with Direct Function Call**
**File**: `nextjs-frontend/src/app/api/paypal/capture-order/route.ts`

**Before (Problematic)**:
```typescript
// Used HTTP fetch with base URL resolution issues
const emailResponse = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/api/email/send-receipt`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ ... }),
});
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```typescript
// Direct function call - no HTTP fetch, no base URL issues
const { sendPaymentReceiptEmailWithRealData } = await import('../../../utils/paymentReceiptEmailer');

const emailResult = await sendPaymentReceiptEmailWithRealData(
  emailPaymentData,
  emailRegistrationData,
  registrationRecord.personalDetails?.email
);
```

### **2. Removed setImmediate() Wrapper**
**Before**: Used `setImmediate()` which doesn't work reliably in serverless environments
**After**: Direct synchronous function call within the PayPal capture route

### **3. Enhanced Error Handling and Logging**
```typescript
} catch (emailError) {
  console.error('‚ùå Error sending email receipt with PDF storage:', {
    error: emailError.message,
    stack: emailError.stack,
    registrationId: actualRegistrationId,
    customerEmail: registrationRecord?.personalDetails?.email,
    transactionId: transactionId,
    orderId: orderId
  });
  // Email failure doesn't affect payment success - log but continue
}
```

## üåê PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS

### **1. Environment Variables (Set in Vercel Dashboard)**:
```
SMTP_HOST=smtpout.secureserver.net
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_SECURE=true
SMTP_USER=contactus@intelliglobalconferences.com
SMTP_PASS=[Your SMTP password]
SANITY_API_TOKEN=[Your Sanity write token]
SANITY_PROJECT_ID=yv5jabaoqicz2jb434bps5g6
SANITY_DATASET=production
```

### **2. Vercel Function Configuration**:
- Ensure function timeout is sufficient for email processing
- Verify memory allocation is adequate for PDF generation
- Check that all dependencies are properly installed

## üéØ EXPECTED PRODUCTION BEHAVIOR

### **Complete Customer Journey**:
1. **Customer Registration**: Customer fills out form at https://nursingeducationconference.org/registration
2. **PayPal Payment**: Customer completes payment via PayPal
3. **Payment Capture**: PayPal calls capture webhook
4. **Immediate Processing**:
   - ‚úÖ Registration status updates to "completed"
   - ‚úÖ Direct function call triggers email processing
   - ‚úÖ PDF receipt is generated with customer data
   - ‚úÖ PDF is uploaded to Sanity CMS asset system
   - ‚úÖ Registration record is updated with PDF references
   - ‚úÖ Confirmation email is sent to customer

### **Sanity CMS Results**:
- ‚úÖ Registrations table shows "completed" payment status
- ‚úÖ PDF column shows "Available" with functional download link
- ‚úÖ PDF contains real customer data (not "N/A" values)

### **Customer Email Results**:
- ‚úÖ Email sent FROM: contactus@intelliglobalconferences.com
- ‚úÖ Email sent TO: Customer's registration form email address
- ‚úÖ Email contains PDF attachment with customer data
- ‚úÖ PDF shows: Customer name, email, phone, country, address, registration type

## üìã PRODUCTION VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

### **1. Sanity CMS Verification**:
**URL**: https://www.sanity.io/@oKsW1XwkS/studio/yv5jabaoqicz2jb434bps5g6/default/structure/registrationSystem;registrationsTableEnhanced

**Check for**:
- New registrations appear after payment completion
- Payment Status shows "completed"
- PDF column shows "Available" with working download link
- PDF download contains correct customer information

### **2. Email Delivery Verification**:
- Customer receives confirmation email immediately after payment
- Email is sent from contactus@intelliglobalconferences.com
- Email contains PDF attachment
- PDF attachment shows correct customer data

### **3. Vercel Function Logs Monitoring**:
- Look for successful email processing messages
- Check for PDF generation and upload success
- Monitor for any error messages or failures
- Verify registration record updates
