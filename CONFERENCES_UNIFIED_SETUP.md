# Unified Conferences Management System

## Overview
The conference management has been consolidated into a single, unified system that provides hierarchical control over the conferences section.

## New Structure

### 🎯 Conferences Section (Unified)
Located at: `http://localhost:3333/structure/conferencesManagement`

#### Components:
1. **⚙️ Conference Section Settings** (Master Control)
   - Global toggle to show/hide entire conferences section
   - Section title and description
   - Display settings (max events, sort order, etc.)

2. **📅 Conference Events** (Individual Events)
   - Individual conference event management
   - Each event has its own toggle switch
   - All existing fields preserved

3. **📝 Legacy Conference Content** (Backward Compatibility)
   - Maintains existing conference section content
   - For migration purposes

## Hierarchical Control Logic

### Master Toggle Control:
- **Master Toggle OFF** → Entire conferences section hidden (regardless of individual event settings)
- **Master Toggle ON** → Section visible, individual event toggles control what shows

### Individual Event Control:
- Only applies when Master Toggle is ON
- Each event can be individually shown/hidden
- Maintains granular control over content

## Setup Instructions

### ✅ Settings Document Already Created
The unified conferences settings document has been automatically created with:
- **Master Toggle**: Currently OFF (conferences section hidden)
- **Section Title**: "Featured Conferences"
- **Max Events**: 6
- **Sort Order**: Date descending

### 1. Access Master Settings
1. Go to Sanity Studio: `http://localhost:3333`
2. Navigate to "🎯 Conferences" → "⚙️ Conference Section Settings"
3. Toggle the master control ON/OFF as needed

### 2. Manage Individual Events
1. Navigate to "🎯 Conferences" → "📅 Conference Events"
2. Each event has "Show on Website" toggle
3. Toggle individual events ON/OFF as needed

### 3. Test the System
1. **Test Master Control**: Toggle master switch OFF → entire section disappears
2. **Test Individual Control**: With master ON, toggle individual events
3. **Verify Hierarchy**: Master OFF overrides all individual settings

## Migration from Old System

### Automatic Migration:
- Existing conference events are preserved
- Individual toggles maintain current state
- Legacy conference content remains accessible

### Manual Setup Required:
1. Create the unified settings document (see Setup Instructions)
2. Configure master toggle and display settings
3. Test the hierarchical control system

## Benefits

✅ **Unified Management**: Single location for all conference controls
✅ **Hierarchical Control**: Master toggle overrides individual settings
✅ **Granular Control**: Individual event toggles for fine-tuning
✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing data and functionality preserved
✅ **Better Organization**: Logical grouping in Sanity Studio
✅ **Improved UX**: Clear hierarchy and control structure

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes:
- Updated queries to use unified settings structure
- Hierarchical rendering logic (master → individual)
- Preserved all existing functionality

### Backend Changes:
- Consolidated schemas into unified structure
- Updated desk structure for better organization
- Maintained backward compatibility

### Data Structure:
```javascript
{
  masterControl: {
    showOnHomepage: boolean,
    title: string,
    description: PortableText[]
  },
  displaySettings: {
    maxEventsToShow: number,
    showOnlyActiveEvents: boolean,
    sortOrder: string
  }
}
```

## Support
If you encounter any issues with the unified system, check:
1. Master settings document is created and configured
2. Individual event toggles are set correctly
3. Frontend is fetching the unified settings structure

## ✅ **FINAL STATUS: PROBLEM RESOLVED**

### 🎯 **Issue Fixed:**
**Problem**: Master toggle was OFF in Sanity, but conferences section still showed on homepage.

### 🔧 **Root Causes Identified & Fixed:**
1. ✅ **Missing Settings Document** - Created unified settings document
2. ✅ **Incorrect Logic** - Fixed frontend condition from `!== false` to `=== true`
3. ✅ **Cache Issue** - Reduced cache from 5 minutes to 1 minute for faster updates

### 🚀 **Current Status:**
- **Master Toggle**: OFF (conferences section properly hidden)
- **Settings Document**: Created and functional
- **Frontend Logic**: Fixed and working correctly
- **Cache Optimization**: 1-minute cache for immediate updates
- **Hierarchical Control**: Fully operational

### 📍 **How to Use:**
1. **Turn ON/OFF**: Go to Sanity Studio → Conferences → Section Settings
2. **Individual Control**: Only works when Master Toggle is ON
3. **Updates**: Changes reflect within 1 minute due to optimized caching

**✅ System is now working perfectly with proper hierarchical control!**
