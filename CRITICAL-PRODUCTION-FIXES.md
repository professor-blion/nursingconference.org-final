# CRITICAL PRODUCTION PAYMENT WORKFLOW FIXES

## üö® Issues Identified and Fixed

### **Primary Production Issues:**
1. **PDF Generation Failure**: After successful real PayPal payment completion, PDF receipts were not generating
2. **Button Functionality Broken**: Print PDF and Download PDF buttons not working after real payments
3. **Email Delivery Failure**: Automated receipt emails not being sent to customers after real payment completion

## ‚úÖ Root Causes Identified and Fixed

### **1. üîç Registration ID Mismatch Problem**
**Issue**: The PayPal flow updates registration ID from `TEMP-REG-xxx` to PayPal Order ID, but APIs were still looking for the old temporary ID.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated all APIs to search by both `registrationId` and `paypalOrderId`
- Modified Sanity queries: `(registrationId == $id || paypalOrderId == $id)`
- Fixed registration lookup in complete workflow API
- Fixed PDF generation API to handle both ID types

### **2. üåê Base URL Environment Variable Issue**
**Issue**: Workflow API calls used `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3000'` which doesn't work in production.

**Fix Applied**:
```javascript
const baseUrl = process.env.VERCEL_URL 
  ? `https://${process.env.VERCEL_URL}` 
  : process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL 
  ? process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL
  : 'http://localhost:3000';
```

### **3. üîÑ Race Condition in Registration Updates**
**Issue**: Multiple functions trying to update the same registration record simultaneously.

**Fix Applied**:
- Consolidated payment status updates in PayPal capture order
- Removed duplicate update calls
- Ensured single source of truth for registration updates

### **4. üìÑ PDF Generation API Registration Lookup**
**Issue**: PDF API only searched by `registrationId`, missing PayPal order IDs.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated Sanity query to include `paypalOrderId`
- Added comprehensive error logging
- Added debugging information for failed lookups

### **5. üîó Success Page URL Generation**
**Issue**: PayPal capture didn't return proper success URL for frontend redirect.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added success URL generation in capture response
- Included all required parameters for success page
- Used actual registration ID (PayPal order ID) instead of temp ID

## üîß Files Modified

### **1. PayPal Capture Order API** (`/api/paypal/capture-order/route.ts`)
- Added Sanity client imports
- Fixed registration record lookup to handle both temp and PayPal IDs
- Updated payment completion workflow with proper base URL
- Added success URL generation for frontend redirect
- Consolidated registration updates to prevent race conditions

### **2. Complete Workflow API** (`/api/payment/complete-workflow/route.ts`)
- Updated registration lookup to search by both ID types
- Added comprehensive error logging and debugging
- Enhanced error responses with search details

### **3. PDF Receipt API** (`/api/registration/receipt-pdf/route.ts`)
- Fixed registration lookup to handle both temp and PayPal IDs
- Added debugging information for failed lookups
- Enhanced error responses with recent registrations for debugging
