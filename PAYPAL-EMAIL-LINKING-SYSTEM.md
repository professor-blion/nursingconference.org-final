# PAYPAL EMAIL LINKING SYSTEM

## 🚨 CRITICAL SOLUTION: REAL CUSTOMER DATA IN PDF RECEIPTS

### **Problem Resolved:**
PDF receipts and success pages were showing "N/A" values instead of real customer data because PayPal orders couldn't be linked to existing registrations.

### **Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Registration Created**: User fills form → `TEMP-REG-MFH46V9N66901-UI3CH16KDSVHWP` created with real customer data
2. **PayPal Order Created**: User pays → PayPal order `6TH64068YS9153249` created with different ID
3. **Linking Failed**: PayPal capture couldn't find registration by order ID
4. **Fallback Used**: System used generic fallback data instead of real customer information

## ✅ COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### **1. 🔗 EMAIL-BASED REGISTRATION LINKING**

**File**: `nextjs-frontend/src/app/api/paypal/capture-order/route.ts`

**Enhanced Lookup Process**:
```javascript
// CRITICAL FIX: Try email-based lookup before orphaned order recovery
if (result?.payer?.email_address) {
  console.log('🔍 Attempting email-based registration lookup...');
  const payerEmail = result.payer.email_address;
  
  const emailBasedRegistration = await client.fetch(
    `*[_type == "conferenceRegistration" && personalDetails.email == $email && paymentStatus == "pending"] | order(registrationDate desc)[0]{
      _id,
      registrationId,
      paypalOrderId,
      personalDetails,
      selectedRegistrationName,
      sponsorType,
      accommodationType,
      accommodationNights,
      numberOfParticipants,
      pricing,
      paymentStatus,
      registrationDate,
      lastUpdated,
      isActive
    }`,
    { email: payerEmail }
  );
  
  if (emailBasedRegistration) {
    console.log('✅ Found registration by email match');
    registrationRecord = emailBasedRegistration;
    actualRegistrationId = emailBasedRegistration.registrationId;
  }
}
```

**Features**:
- **Email-Based Lookup**: Finds existing registrations by PayPal payer email
- **Automatic Linking**: Links PayPal order ID to found registration
- **Real Data Usage**: Uses actual customer data instead of fallback
- **Payment Status Update**: Updates registration to completed status

### **2. 🔧 ENHANCED REGISTRATION LOOKUP FLOW**

**Step-by-Step Process**:
1. **Primary Lookup**: Search by PayPal order ID (for already linked orders)
2. **Email Fallback**: Search by payer email address (for unlinked orders)
3. **Automatic Linking**: Link PayPal order ID to found registration
4. **Orphaned Recovery**: Create recovery registration only if no match found

**Benefits**:
- **Connects Existing Data**: Links orphaned PayPal orders to real registrations
- **Preserves Customer Data**: Uses actual customer information from registration form
- **Reduces Fallback Usage**: Minimizes need for generic fallback data
- **Improves Accuracy**: Ensures PDF receipts show real customer details
