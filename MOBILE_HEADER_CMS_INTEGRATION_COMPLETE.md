# Mobile Header CMS Integration - Complete Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation of mobile header CMS integration with visibility toggle functionality, ESLint error fixes, and proper Sanity CMS backend configuration.

## ‚úÖ Tasks Completed

### 1. ESLint Errors Fixed
- **Fixed TypeScript error in getSiteSettings.ts**: Updated `getImageUrl` function parameter type from `any` to proper interface
- **Fixed React unescaped entities error in page.tsx**: Replaced apostrophe in "today's" with `&apos;`
- **All ESLint warnings and errors resolved**: Both frontend and backend now pass linting

### 2. Sanity CMS Backend Configuration Enhanced

#### Updated Schema Fields in `siteSettings.ts`:

**Header Visibility Toggle:**
```typescript
headerVisibility: {
  showHeaderSection: boolean (default: true)
}
```

**Enhanced Contact Information:**
```typescript
contactInfo: {
  email: string (required, email validation)
  phone: string (phone number validation)
  whatsapp: string (required, phone number validation)
  address: text (optional)
}
```

**Enhanced Social Media Links:**
```typescript
socialMedia: {
  linkedin: url (with validation)
  facebook: url (with validation)
  twitter: url (X/Twitter with validation)
  instagram: url (with validation)
}
```

#### Validation Features Added:
- Email validation for contact email
- Phone number regex validation for phone and WhatsApp
- URL validation for all social media links
- Required field validation for email and WhatsApp
- Descriptive help text for all fields

### 3. Frontend Integration Updates

#### Updated TypeScript Interfaces:
- Added `headerVisibility` field to `SiteSettings` interface
- Updated Sanity query to fetch `headerVisibility` data
- Fixed type compatibility issues between interfaces

#### Header Component Visibility Toggle:
```typescript
// Conditional rendering based on CMS setting
const isHeaderSectionVisible = siteSettings?.headerVisibility?.showHeaderSection !== false;

return (
  <header>
    {isHeaderSectionVisible && (
      <div className="bg-blue-900 text-white py-1.5 px-1">
        {/* All mobile header contact/social content */}
      </div>
    )}
    {/* Main navigation always visible */}
  </header>
);
```

### 4. Integration Features

#### CMS Dashboard Control:
- **Header Contact Section Visibility**: Toggle to show/hide entire header section
- **Contact Information Management**: Full control over email, phone, WhatsApp, address
- **Social Media Management**: LinkedIn, Facebook, X (Twitter), Instagram URLs
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes in Sanity immediately reflect on website

#### Responsive Behavior Maintained:
- All existing mobile responsiveness preserved
- Professional SVG social media icons maintained
- Proper spacing and alignment maintained
- Single-line mobile layout preserved
